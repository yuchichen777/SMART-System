How To Set Goals
To help you write goals that will work, try the SMART system. Each letter in the word "smart" represents an important part of your goal.

Specific — Have a specific, clear focus. For example, “make 10 job search calls” is very specific. “Make some networking connections” is not specific.

Measurable — Make sure you have a way to measure your progress. Ask yourself the following questions about your goal: How much? How many? How will I know when it is accomplished? Try questions that focus on something that can be counted. For example, your goal might include how much time you want to spend on a project, how much money you want to make, or how many people you want to connect with.

Attainable — Goals should be attainable, or possible to reach. A goal is attainable when the steps are planned clearly and you have enough time to complete them. How do you plan to reach your goal? What steps should you take? Is the goal realistic based on where you are now? You should set a goal that is a challenge. However, your goal should not be impossible.

Relevant — A relevant goal is one that really matters to you and is important. Is it worth the energy? Is this the right time? Does your career goal fit into your life goals and future plans? Is there anything you will need to reach your goal that you don't currently have?

Timely — A goal should have a clear timeline. This will help keep you focused. Decide when do you want to start working on your goal. Then ask yourself: When should I complete each step?


Here are a few tips for reaching your SMART goal:
Make A List
Write down your goal. Then write down the steps you will take to get there. This will help you to remember and accomplish each step. Put your list where you will see it.

Set Deadlines
Give yourself a date to complete your goals. Set a deadline for each step. Write down the date when you finish each step.

Reward Yourself
Working toward goals is hard. Think of small rewards to give yourself when you complete each step. The rewards will help you stay motivated.

Have A Goal Partner
Find someone to help you. The person can be a friend, co-worker, job coach or anyone else. Discuss your goals together, and meet up when you complete each step. If possible, do the same for your partner
